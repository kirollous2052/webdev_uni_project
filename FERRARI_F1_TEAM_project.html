<h2> F1 Team</h2>
<img src="images_waap/f1.jpg" alt="Charles" width="200px" height="200px">

<pre>    The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo. 
    By 1947, Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One
    are winning the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Spa, 24 Hours of Daytona,
    12 Hours of Sebring, Bathurst 12 Hour, races for Grand tourer cars, and racing on road courses of the Targa Florio,
    the Mille Miglia, and the Carrera Panamericana. The team is also known for its passionate support base,
    known as the tifosi. The Italian Grand Prix at Monza is regarded as the team's home race.


    he team is named after its founder Enzo Ferrari. Scuderia is Italian for a stable reserved for racing horses,
    and is also commonly applied to Italian motor racing teams. The prancing horse was the symbol used on Italian
    World War I ace Francesco Baracca's fighter plane. It became the logo of Ferrari after the fallen ace's parents,
    close acquaintances of Enzo Ferrari, suggested that Ferrari use the symbol as the logo of the Scuderia,
    telling him it would "bring him good luck".
