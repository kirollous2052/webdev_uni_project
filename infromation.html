        The Ferrari F40 (Type F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car[12] engineered by Nicola Materazzi 
        with styling by Pininfarina. It was built from 1987 until 1992, with the LM and GTE race car versions continuing production 
        until 1994 and 1996 respectively.[15] As the successor to the 288 GTO (also engineered by Materazzi), it was designed to  
        celebrate Ferrari's40th anniversary and was the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari.
         [1] At the time it was Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car for sale.[16]
        The car debuted with a planned production total of four hundred units and a factory suggested retail price of approximately
        US$400,000 (fivefold the price of its predecessor, the 288 GTO[17]) in 1987 ($1,070,000 today).[18] One of those that belonged 
        to the Formula One driver Nigel Mansell was sold for the then record of £1 million in 1990, a record that stood into the 2010s
        19][20] A total of 1,311[1][21] to 1,315 cars were manufactured with 213 units destined for the United States.[22]
