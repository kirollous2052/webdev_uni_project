        <p class="news-content">Under the leadership of CEO Benedetto Vigna, Ferrari is witnessing significant evolution
          and enhancement of its global market share.
        </p>
        <div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
          <p class="news-content"> Since taking the helm in 2021, Vigna has doubled the company's value, with the share
            price soaring to $389. He achieved this through reducing bureaucracy and fostering closer relationships with
            employees, which contributed to faster decision-making and product improvements. Ferrari is also moving away
            from traditional engines, with hybrid cars making up half of the company's sales last year. This development
            reflects Ferrari's commitment to innovation and excellence in the luxury car industry.
