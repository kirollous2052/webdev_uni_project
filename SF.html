<h3 title="F1"> Formula 1 Racing</h3>


<pre>
    1.History: Formula 1 traces its roots back to the early 20th century, with the first World Championship race
    held in 1950 at Silverstone, United Kingdom. Since then, Formula 1 has evolved into a premier international racing series, 
    attracting millions of fans worldwide.

    2.Race Format: Formula 1 races typically take place over a race weekend, which includes practice sessions, 
    qualifying, and the race itself. Qualifying determines the starting grid for the race, with drivers
    competing to set the fastest lap times. The race itself consists of a set number of laps around a circuit,
    with the first driver to cross the finish line declared the winner.

    3.Teams and Drivers: Formula 1 features teams representing manufacturers or independent entities,
    each fielding two cars driven by professional racing drivers. Teams invest heavily in research,
    development, and engineering to gain a competitive edge over their rivals. Drivers compete not only
    for individual glory but also to contribute points to their team's championship standings.

    4.Technical Regulations: Formula 1 cars are some of the most technologically advanced racing 
    machines in the world. The sport is governed by strict technical regulations that dictate various 
    aspects of car design, including dimensions, weight, aerodynamics, engines, and safety features.
    These regulations aim to ensure fairness, competitiveness, and safety on the track.

    5.Global Calendar: The Formula 1 calendar consists of races held at iconic circuits around the world, 
    spanning multiple continents. Grand Prix events take place in diverse locations, from historic tracks
    like Monza in Italy and Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium to modern venues like Yas Marina Circuit
    in Abu Dhabi and Circuit of the Americas in the United States.

    6.Championships: Formula 1 crowns two main championships each season: the Drivers' Championship 
    and the Constructors' Championship. The Drivers' Championship is awarded to the driver who 
    accumulates the most points over the course of the season, while the Constructors' Championship 
    is awarded to the team with the highest cumulative points scored by its drivers.

    Global Appeal: Formula 1 boasts a massive global following, with millions of fans tuning in to watch 
    races on television, online streams, and live broadcasts. The sport's appeal extends beyond the
    racetrack, with fans following teams, drivers, and developments in the world of Formula 1
    throughout the year.
